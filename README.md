# Harvard-CS50-2021

---

Here included are all the programs and a personal final project written during the CS50 course.

## About

Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming is a course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.

## Additional assignments

In **all** of the week(1 - 9) folders there are not only problem set files (which I consider the main challenge of the course) but also lab assignents and lecture coding follow-alongs. Lab assignments were also intriguing and sometimes difficult but well worth the effort.

## What I've learned

CS50 was an amazing experience which not only provided substantial amounts of knowledge, but also tought the whole philosophy of programming, how to see things logicaly and solve arising problems computationaly. All the coding challenges forced me out of my comfort zone and yet proved to be solvable even without often relying on other resources. I am thankful to the CS50's Harvard team for proving that computer science can not only be a very valuable skill but also a great fun!
